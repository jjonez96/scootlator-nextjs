## API's

- Google maps API (map, places and autocomplete)
- Tier API
- Voi API

## How it works?

In Scootlator you choose your origin and destination where you want to go from point A to point B.

There is different ways to get origin and destination. Mostly used method is to just write them and Google Autocomplete gives you suggestions based on where you are located. You can choose the destination by clicking the map or just write it. <br> When origin and destination are selected then you choose your operator which shows their prices and then you are ready to calculate the price.

<b>Other ways to get origin:</b>

1. Click location button in origin input. This button takes you to your location.

2. Pick scoot from the map and click the location button.

<b>You can find scoots in Örebro Sweden only at the moment.</b> <br>
<b>When you click scoot icon in the map you see information of that scoot:</b>

- What type of vehicle.
- Battery left.
- Location button. This gives you that selected scoot address to origin input.
- "Vuokraa" means Rent and that button takes you to the Tier or Voi app where you can make the payment.

<br> <br>

Blue scoot button in the left disables all scoots in the map and right side that red button will reset the whole app.

<br> <br>

When the trip is calculated the app will return you the results like distance, duration and the price of that trip. <br>
Here in Finland all scoot operators will slow down scoots at night times and the trip price will obviously increase. Price is increased at 10PM - 6AM

Scootdata comes from my Node.js backend. It is server to server solution where i do http requests from tier and voiapi. The Node application is hosted to Cyclic.sh.
